# personal-website

Hi. I hope you enjoy my website. To be clear I did follow a tutorial however I made individual changes and customizations that allowed me to learn both HTML and CSS. 
The website is not fully complete as some of the active tabs are not finished but I will have that done in the coming week.
Lastly, one final task to complete with this website involves me using what I've in my SQL/Databases class. This involves me using Node JS to combine MySQL with the HTML. By doing this, I am able to implement my own database that collects and stores visitors' information instead of merely attaching a google sheets. Again, this task is to utilize what I have learned in class as well as expand upon my knowledge and skills that will carry over to later projects.

Thanks!
